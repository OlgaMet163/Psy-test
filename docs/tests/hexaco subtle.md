HEXACO (two-facet) constructed to align with those Big Five aspects
1) Honesty–Humility (captures much of Big Five “Politeness,” plus what Big Five misses)

Sincerity (low manipulation, straightforwardness)

Fairness (low cheating/exploitation; rule-of-fair-play)

2) Emotionality (covers Big Five “Withdrawal,” and part of “Compassion”)

Anxiety (worry, threat sensitivity, rumination)

Sentimentality (empathic attachment, tenderness, being emotionally moved)

3) Extraversion (cleanest one-to-one with Big Five Extraversion aspects)

Social Boldness (dominance/initiative in social contexts)

Liveliness (high positive affect, energetic expressiveness)

4) Agreeableness (in HEXACO, this is especially about anger/irritability regulation)

Patience (low irritability; opposite pole of Big Five Volatility)

Forgiveness (letting go of resentment; conflict repair)

5) Conscientiousness

Organization (structure/order; Big Five Orderliness)

Diligence (effort/persistence; Big Five Industriousness)

6) Openness to Experience

Inquisitiveness (idea-curiosity; Big Five Intellect)

Aesthetic Appreciation (beauty/art/sensory richness; Big Five Aesthetic Openness)

20. How often do you need urgency (deadline/pressure) to finish dull tasks? (R)

21. How often do you dig into underlying principles rather than just doing what works?

22. How often do you avoid deep-dives and prefer “just tell me the steps”? (R)

24. How often do you treat aesthetics as irrelevant as long as it functions? (R)

Optional add-on: “response-quality / impression management” items (bullshit detector)

These are not lie detectors. They are flags for idealized self-presentation (answering “too perfect”), which can inflate scores in H-H/A, suppress Emotionality, and inflate Conscientiousness.

Use the same 1–5 scale. Add them to any B or C form; they do not replace facet items.

B-style (interview) add-ons (6 items; 2 per target area)

HH/A (2 items)

25. IM-1: I can’t recall the last time I intentionally framed a story to make myself look better.

26. IM-2: Even under pressure, I never feel irritated with other people.

Emotionality (2 items)

27. IM-3: I almost never feel nervous or uncertain, even in high-stakes situations.

28. IM-4: I rarely lose any sleep over unresolved issues.

Conscientiousness (2 items)

29. IM-5: I have never procrastinated on anything important.

30. IM-6: I have never been late or missed a commitment that mattered.
