DSUSI-SF (Indirect) — Short Form (38 items)
Instructions (read verbatim)

“Think about the last 2–3 months in high-pressure situations (deadlines, conflict, uncertainty, fatigue). Answer based on what tends to happen in practice, not your ideal self.”

Scale (1–5):
1 = Never / 2 = Rarely / 3 = Sometimes / 4 = Often / 5 = Very often

Items

Write a 1–5 score for each statement.

**Volatile Reactivity (VR)**
1. When a project hits turbulence, my urgency shows up in my tone.

2. In tense weeks, small setbacks feel bigger than they “should.”

3. (R) Even when provoked, I keep my tone measured.

**Worry-Driven Avoidance (WA)**

4. When stakes rise, I prefer to gather extra data before committing.

5. I build contingency plans before I feel comfortable moving.

6. (R) I can make a call with incomplete information without replaying it afterward.

**Interpersonal Withdrawal (IW)**

7. When pressure climbs, I reduce conversation to stay focused.

8. During crunch time, people may notice I’m harder to read emotionally.

9. (R) In stressful periods, I intentionally check in with others even if I’m busy.

**Cynical Guardedness (CG)**

10. When things get political, I prefer agreements in writing.

11. Under stress, I scrutinize others’ intentions more carefully.

12. (R) In high-pressure situations, I assume most people mean well.

**Passive Pushback (PP)**

13. If I disagree, I may comply first and revisit the decision later.

14. When I feel pushed, I stick to my interpretation of the request.

15. (R) If I commit to an approach I dislike, I follow through without quiet resistance.

**Self-Importance (SI)**

16. In critical moments, I trust my judgment more than group consensus.

17. I can get protective of decisions that have my name on them.

18. (R) Under pressure, I actively look for evidence that I might be wrong.

**Boundary-Pushing (BP)**

19. To keep momentum, I sometimes bypass steps that feel bureaucratic.

20. When deadlines bite, I’m comfortable taking calculated risks others avoid.

21. (R) Even in crunch time, I avoid bending process rules.

**Spotlight Seeking (SS)**

22. In high-stakes work, I increase how much I communicate my progress.

23. When pressure is high, I work harder to make my contributions visible.

24. (R) When stressed, I’m fine letting results speak without drawing attention.

**Unconventional Thinking (UT)**

25. Under stress, I jump to novel angles others haven’t considered.

26. I can get absorbed in big ideas and lose track of practical constraints.

27. (R) When pressure rises, I deliberately anchor on concrete facts.

**Perfectionistic Control (PC)**

28. When quality matters, I prefer to personally review or refine the final output.

29. In crunch time, I step in to ensure details are handled correctly.

30. (R) When stressed, I can delegate and accept solutions done differently than I would.

**Approval Dependence (AD)**

31. When stakes are high, I seek early alignment from key stakeholders.

32. I may say yes quickly to avoid disappointing people.

33. (R) Under pressure, I can say no without needing reassurance.

**Validity screen: Impression Management (IM)**

(High scores suggest “too good to be true” responding.)

34. In the last year, I can’t recall a situation where I spoke too sharply.

35. I’ve never had to apologize at work for my tone or approach.

36. No matter the stress level, I always make the perfect decision.

37. I have never felt defensive when receiving feedback.

38. I never cut corners—ever—even when time is tight.

Scoring

Reverse-score (R) items: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33
Reverse rule: Reversed = 6 − response

Scale score = mean of its 3 items (after reversing R items).
IM score = mean of items 34–38.

Interpretation (non-normed, development use)

≥ 3.8 on a derailer scale: likely visible to others under stress

3.2–3.7: moderate/occasional risk

< 3.2: lower expression (or possibly defensiveness if IM is high)

IM flag: if IM ≥ 4.2, assume underreporting is likely; treat low derailer scores cautiously.

11 traits are essentially a 1:1 conceptual re-labeling of the 11 Hogan Development Survey (HDS) derailers. HDS scales were designed to resemble subclinical (workplace-level) expressions of classic DSM personality-disorder prototypes, rather than to diagnose disorders.
