# Hogan Derailers Coaching & Interaction Compendium
*(HDS 11 maladaptive tendencies at elevated/high levels; plus pair/triple/quadruple combinations)*

## Important framing (so the guidance is used correctly)
- Hogan Development Survey (HDS) scales describe **normal‑range derailers**: patterns that can become counterproductive **under stress, fatigue, threat, or unstructured power**. They are not clinical diagnoses.
- A “high score” does not mean the person is ‘bad’—it means the tendency is **easier to trigger** and **more costly** when uncontained.
- The aim of coaching here is **ethical performance**: clearer agreements, safer conflict, better decisions, less interpersonal damage—never manipulation.

## Two rules that prevent most derailment (across all traits)
1. **Reduce threat + increase clarity**: make roles, decision rights, success criteria, and boundaries explicit.
2. **Shorten feedback loops**: smaller commitments, faster data, earlier escalations, and written capture of decisions.

## How to use the combo guides (pairs / triples / quadruples)
For any combination, treat it as a **system** with:
- a *primary protection goal* (what they’re defending against),
- a *default stress move* (attack / withdraw / freeze / comply / perform / resist / risk),
- and a *recovery style* (repair quickly vs distance vs grudge vs rule‑gaming).

Each combo guide provides:
- a stress signature (what you’ll see as pressure rises),
- derail risks (what to prevent),
- a coaching stance (structure/autonomy/warmth/directness/guardrails),
- do/avoid behaviors,
- a micro‑contract (rules that pre‑empt derailment),
- a fast reset script for real-time de‑escalation.

# Part 1 — Single high traits (the 11 HDS scales)


---

## Excitable (high score)

**Core need / fear**: needs reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures; tends to fear being let down, abandoned, or trapped with disappointment.

**How it typically shows up under stress**: escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’.

**Likely strengths (when well-managed)**:
- passion
- energy when engaged
- alerts others early to problems
- high standards for relationships

**Common derail risks**:
- mood-driven decisions
- relationship whiplash (idealize → devalue)
- burning bridges
- team anxiety

**Common triggers**:
- broken promises
- perceived rejection
- last‑minute changes without explanation
- inconsistent leadership

**How to interact day-to-day (works well)**:
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid / don’t do**:
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.

**Feedback that lands**: Deliver feedback privately, quickly, and behaviorally: ‘When X happened, Y impact. Next time do Z.’ End with a clear recommitment and a near-term checkpoint.

**Coaching for results (keep them on-track)**:
- Translate goals into 1–2 week sprints with visible progress metrics.
- Build an ‘if/then’ plan for common triggers (e.g., if scope changes, then a 10‑minute reset call before decisions).
- Teach rupture-repair skills: timeouts, return-to-topic, and apology/ownership scripts.

**If you live with them (partner / family / close colleague)**:
- Prioritize consistency over intensity: steady routines, predictable plans, and explicit expectations.
- Don’t negotiate during peak emotion; validate, pause, then revisit with options.
- Use ‘micro-reassurance’ (small confirmations of commitment) rather than grand gestures.


---

## Skeptical (high score)

**Core need / fear**: needs fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith; tends to fear being exploited, deceived, or made to look foolish.

**How it typically shows up under stress**: questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges.

**Likely strengths (when well-managed)**:
- risk sensing
- detects inconsistencies
- protects standards and fairness
- robust debate

**Common derail risks**:
- conflict escalation
- low trust climate
- defensiveness in others
- slow decisions due to argument loops

**Common triggers**:
- vague explanations
- back-channel decisions
- perceived disrespect
- politics or favoritism

**How to interact day-to-day (works well)**:
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.

**Avoid / don’t do**:
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).

**Feedback that lands**: Use ‘data + fairness’ framing: ‘Here’s what we agreed, what happened, and why it matters. Here’s the corrective plan.’ Invite their critique of the plan (channels energy into improvement).

**Coaching for results (keep them on-track)**:
- Create a ‘rules of engagement’ for conflict: time limits, evidence standards, and escalation paths.
- Coach them to test assumptions via questions rather than accusations (swap ‘You did this to…’ for ‘Help me understand…’).
- Use pre‑mortems and red‑team roles to legitimize skepticism without poisoning relationships.

**If you live with them (partner / family / close colleague)**:
- Be consistent and direct; avoid hidden agendas and social triangulation.
- Repair quickly when you miss a commitment; own it plainly.
- Don’t over-disclose private vulnerabilities too early; build trust through reliability first.


---

## Cautious (high score)

**Core need / fear**: needs psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn; tends to fear making a mistake that leads to embarrassment, loss, or punishment.

**How it typically shows up under stress**: slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance.

**Likely strengths (when well-managed)**:
- prudence
- quality control
- plans for downside
- reduces preventable errors

**Common derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- missed opportunities
- over‑dependence on approval
- innovation suppression

**Common triggers**:
- public criticism
- unclear success criteria
- high ambiguity with high stakes
- rapid change without runway

**How to interact day-to-day (works well)**:
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Make success criteria explicit and binary where possible (what ‘good’ looks like).
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Normalize learning: review decisions by quality of process, not outcome alone.
- Provide rehearsal and pre‑briefs before high-stakes interactions.

**Avoid / don’t do**:
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Vague encouragement (‘Be bolder’) without guardrails.
- Threat-based motivation (‘If this fails…’).
- Rewarding only perfect outcomes.

**Feedback that lands**: Give feedback as risk management: ‘To protect the outcome, we need X by Y.’ Pair critique with a concrete plan and a small next step within 24–72 hours.

**Coaching for results (keep them on-track)**:
- Train ‘minimum viable decision’ skills: decide with 70% info, then iterate.
- Build a personal ‘risk budget’ aligned to role (what risks are expected and acceptable).
- Use exposure ladders: gradually increase visibility and uncertainty.

**If you live with them (partner / family / close colleague)**:
- Keep commitments and routines; give advanced notice for changes.
- When they spiral, anchor them in the next smallest action.
- Avoid shaming language; focus on joint problem-solving.


---

## Reserved (high score)

**Core need / fear**: needs space, autonomy, and low-pressure connection; tends to fear being overwhelmed by demands, emotion, or forced intimacy.

**How it typically shows up under stress**: withdraws, reduces communication, becomes terse; may appear indifferent.

**Likely strengths (when well-managed)**:
- calm under pressure
- independent work
- objectivity
- doesn’t overreact socially

**Common derail risks**:
- low collaboration
- missed signals
- others feel dismissed
- silent disengagement

**Common triggers**:
- intrusive check-ins
- emotionally intense confrontations
- forced sharing
- overly social work norms

**How to interact day-to-day (works well)**:
- Use concise, agenda-driven interactions; send context in writing ahead of time.
- Ask specific questions and allow time to think (silence is processing, not defiance).
- Respect boundaries around personal topics; build trust via competence and reliability.
- Create clear interfaces: what you need from them, by when, and how you’ll communicate.
- Acknowledge contributions without demanding emotional display (‘That analysis improved the decision’).

**Avoid / don’t do**:
- Interpreting low warmth as hostility.
- Ambushing them with emotive feedback or group confrontation.
- Over-scheduling synchronous meetings.
- Pushing ‘team bonding’ as a requirement for trust.

**Feedback that lands**: Give feedback calmly and precisely; focus on observable behaviors and downstream impacts. Offer options for communication norms (e.g., written updates vs meetings).

**Coaching for results (keep them on-track)**:
- Coach proactive signaling: early status updates, explicit risks, and clear asks.
- Build a ‘minimum collaboration contract’ (what must be shared, when).
- Develop relational micro-skills that don’t feel performative: short appreciation, clear ‘I need/ I can’ statements.

**If you live with them (partner / family / close colleague)**:
- Share space without constant conversation; parallel activity builds closeness safely.
- Discuss conflict with a ‘cool’ tone; agree on time to revisit instead of chasing immediate resolution.
- Let them initiate some contact; don’t equate distance with lack of care.


---

## Leisurely (high score)

**Core need / fear**: needs choice, respect, and control over how work gets done; tends to fear being controlled, pressured, or losing autonomy/status quietly.

**How it typically shows up under stress**: appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way.

**Likely strengths (when well-managed)**:
- independence
- steady pace
- can push back on bad ideas indirectly
- doesn’t chase fads

**Common derail risks**:
- passive resistance
- missed deadlines
- frustrated stakeholders
- covert conflict

**Common triggers**:
- micromanagement
- orders without rationale
- public pressure
- tight monitoring framed as distrust

**How to interact day-to-day (works well)**:
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Make commitments explicit: deliverable, date, quality bar, and what ‘done’ means.
- Use calm firmness on consequences (impact-based, not moralizing).
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’

**Avoid / don’t do**:
- Telling them exactly how to do everything.
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.
- Public cornering.

**Feedback that lands**: Feedback must connect behavior to impact and choice: ‘When X wasn’t delivered, Y consequence. For next cycle, choose A or B—either works, but we need a clear commitment.’

**Coaching for results (keep them on-track)**:
- Teach ‘direct disagreement’: express concerns early instead of resisting later.
- Use performance contracts with mutually agreed checkpoints (they help you, not surveil you).
- Build negotiation skills: how to say no, propose alternatives, and trade scope.

**If you live with them (partner / family / close colleague)**:
- Respect autonomy and routines; avoid nagging.
- Use agreements, not hints. Confirm understanding explicitly.
- If resentment builds, invite direct conversation without blame; offer choices.

## Bold (high score)

**Core need / fear**: needs status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly; tends to fear being seen as ordinary, weak, or not in control.

**How it typically shows up under stress**: overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others.

**How to interact day-to-day (works well)**:
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).

**Avoid / don’t do**:
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Rewarding theatrics over results.

**Feedback that lands**: Feedback should be framed as protecting their legacy: ‘To achieve X, we must address Y. Here’s the measurable standard.’ Use peer/market evidence rather than opinion.

**Coaching for results (keep them on-track)**:
- Develop ‘strategic humility’: pre-mortems, red-team inputs, and ‘what would change my mind’ criteria.
- Coach credit-sharing rituals: naming contributors, building successors, and protecting talent.
- Install ethical guardrails and role-modeling expectations with real consequences.

**If you live with them (partner / family / close colleague)**:
- Do not try to ‘win’ arguments; set boundaries and exit escalation calmly.
- Don’t rely on apology; rely on agreements and consequences.
- Reinforce prosocial status: admiration for fairness, generosity, and responsibility.


---

## Mischievous (high score)

**Core need / fear**: needs stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries; tends to fear being constrained, bored, or trapped by rules and routine.

**How it typically shows up under stress**: takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize.

**Likely strengths (when well-managed)**:

**Common triggers**:
- rigid bureaucracy
- slow approvals
- repetitive work
- being told ‘no’ without rationale

**How to interact day-to-day (works well)**:
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid / don’t do**:
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.

**Feedback that lands**: Use ‘freedom via discipline’ framing: ‘These guardrails keep you in the game. Inside them, you have wide latitude.’ Make it about access to opportunities, not punishment.

**Coaching for results (keep them on-track)**:
- Build impulse control systems: pre‑commitments, checklists for high-risk decisions, and a ‘cooling-off’ rule for big bets.
- Develop empathy/accountability: link actions to stakeholder impact.
- Install a ‘trusted checker’ (peer or partner) who reviews risk decisions without shaming.

**If you live with them (partner / family / close colleague)**:
- Protect shared resources (money, trust, time) with explicit agreements.
- Assume novelty-seeking; plan healthy outlets and boundaries.
- If deception appears, treat it as a hard stop and reset with consequences.

## Colorful (high score)

**Core need / fear**: needs attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally; tends to fear being ignored, invisible, or not valued.

**How it typically shows up under stress**: gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details.

**Likely strengths (when well-managed)**:
- engagement

**Common derail risks**:
- overpromising
- distracting the team
- credit-seeking conflict
- poor listening

**Common triggers**:
- being sidelined
- dry technical conversations without ‘room’
- lack of recognition
- being corrected publicly

**How to interact day-to-day (works well)**:
- Give structured airtime (time-boxed updates, storytelling with a point).
- Summarize decisions and actions in writing to lock in specifics.
- Praise substance (impact, outcomes) more than performance (charisma).
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.
- Create a ‘stage’ that serves the mission (presentations, community), not internal drama.

**Avoid / don’t do**:
- Letting meetings become unbounded monologues.
- Publicly embarrassing them.
- Assuming enthusiasm equals follow-through.
- Starving them of recognition and then being surprised by attention-seeking.

**Feedback that lands**: Start with acknowledgement, then tighten: ‘Your energy helped. To maximize impact, we need fewer claims and more specifics—here are the three commitments.’

**Coaching for results (keep them on-track)**:
- Install commitment discipline: ‘Say it, write it, calendar it.’
- Teach ‘signal vs noise’: one core message, three supporting points, one ask.
- Use metrics tied to credibility: promises kept, follow-through rate, stakeholder ratings.

**If you live with them (partner / family / close colleague)**:
- Balance warmth with boundaries on time and attention.
- Don’t reward drama; reward calm clarity.
- Plan regular appreciation so it doesn’t get demanded in disruptive ways.

## Imaginative (high score)

**Core need / fear**: needs novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas; tends to fear being boxed in, forced into conventional thinking, or losing creative identity.

**How it typically shows up under stress**: pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow.

**Likely strengths (when well-managed)**:
- innovation
- pattern recognition
- vision
- breakthrough thinking

**Common derail risks**:
- impractical plans
- scope creep
- confusing communication
- alienating pragmatic stakeholders

**Common triggers**:
- overly rigid rules
- dismissive ‘that won’t work’ reactions
- detail-heavy bureaucracy
- being forced to justify too early

**How to interact day-to-day (works well)**:
- Start with curiosity: ‘What problem are you solving?’ then translate into constraints.
- Use ‘two-track’ execution: ideation track + feasibility track with clear gates.
- Require a one-page narrative: goal, hypothesis, test, success metric, risks.
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.
- Time-box exploration and set decision dates.

**Avoid / don’t do**:
- Killing ideas instantly without acknowledging the underlying insight.
- Letting ideas skip feasibility/ethics checks.
- Overloading them with micromanaged step-by-step instructions.
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.

**Feedback that lands**: Validate novelty, then ground: ‘The insight is strong. To ship it, we need a testable hypothesis, a metric, and a constraint set.’

**Coaching for results (keep them on-track)**:
- Teach ‘translation’: turn concepts into experiments and requirements.
- Use pre‑mortems to surface hidden risks without dampening creativity.
- Build stakeholder empathy: how the message lands on operators, customers, regulators.

**If you live with them (partner / family / close colleague)**:
- Give them room for creative expression, but protect shared obligations with agreements.
- When they ‘spiral into ideas,’ anchor to the next concrete test.

- process discipline
- high personal standards

**Common derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- team demoralization
- innovation suppression

- ambiguity
- sloppy work
- missed details
- others not caring as much

**How to interact day-to-day (works well)**:
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.

**Avoid / don’t do**:
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.

**Feedback that lands**: Use throughput framing: ‘Your standards help. The risk is speed/ownership. Here’s the boundary: you review X; the team owns Y. We’ll measure cycle time and defects.’

**Coaching for results (keep them on-track)**:
- Teach 80/20 quality: which elements drive outcomes vs perfectionism.
- Build coaching skills: ask questions, set standards, then let others execute.
- Use retrospectives to adjust standards objectively.

**If you live with them (partner / family / close colleague)**:
- Agree on shared standards (money, cleanliness, time) rather than fighting daily.
- Don’t promise what you can’t deliver; it creates control escalation.
- Invite them to ‘park’ minor issues and revisit on a schedule.


---

## Dutiful (high score)

**Core need / fear**: needs clear expectations, approval, and relational security; tends to fear disapproval, abandonment by authority, or being seen as disloyal.

- fear of letting others down

**How to interact day-to-day (works well)**:
- Give explicit permission—and expectations—to disagree (‘I need your dissent if you see risk’).
- Ask for independent recommendations before group discussion (reduces conformity).
- Set prioritization rules: what to drop when capacity is exceeded.
- Praise principled pushback and boundary setting.
- Create decision rights: which decisions they own without approval.

**Avoid / don’t do**:
- Rewarding ‘always yes’ behavior.
- Using guilt or loyalty tests.
- Leaving them with unclear priorities.
- Assuming silence equals agreement.

**Feedback that lands**: Frame feedback as empowerment: ‘Your loyalty is valuable. To protect the mission, I need you to surface problems early and say no when needed.’

**Coaching for results (keep them on-track)**:
- Teach assertiveness scripts: ‘I can do A or B by Friday, not both.’
- Build comfort with mild disapproval; use graded exposure.

# Part 2 — High trait pairs (55)


---

### Excitable + Skeptical

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- conflict escalation
- low trust climate
- mood-driven decisions

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, very high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**


---

### Excitable + Cautious

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- missed opportunities
- mood-driven decisions
- relationship whiplash (idealize → devalue)

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, high warmth, moderate directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**

### Excitable + Reserved

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Reserved wants space, autonomy, and low-pressure connection. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Reserved typically withdraws, reduces communication, becomes terse; may appear indifferent. Together this often produces hot–cold engagement: intense reactions followed by shutdown and avoidance.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- low collaboration
- missed signals
- mood-driven decisions
- relationship whiplash (idealize → devalue)

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, low guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Acknowledge contributions without demanding emotional display (‘That analysis improved the decision’).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “It seems we’re going quiet. Let’s capture questions in writing and reconvene tomorrow with a decision.”**

### Excitable + Leisurely

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- missed deadlines
- mood-driven decisions
- passive resistance
- relationship whiplash (idealize → devalue)

**Coach stance: very high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Excitable + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- ignoring risks
- mood-driven decisions
- relationship whiplash (idealize → devalue)
- toxic ego culture

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- ethics/compliance violations
- mood-driven decisions
- reckless decisions
- relationship whiplash (idealize → devalue)

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Excitable + Colorful

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- distracting the team
- mood-driven decisions
- overpromising
- relationship whiplash (idealize → devalue)

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, high warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**

### Excitable + Imaginative

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- impractical plans
- mood-driven decisions
- relationship whiplash (idealize → devalue)
- scope creep

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**

### Excitable + Diligent

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- mood-driven decisions
- relationship whiplash (idealize → devalue)
- team demoralization

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:

### Excitable + Dutiful

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Dutiful wants clear expectations, approval, and relational security. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Dutiful typically defers to others, says yes too quickly, avoids conflict; later feels resentful or overwhelmed. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- lack of candor
- mood-driven decisions
- overcommitment
- relationship whiplash (idealize → devalue)

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, high warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**

### Skeptical + Cautious

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- low trust climate
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**

### Skeptical + Reserved

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Reserved wants space, autonomy, and low-pressure connection. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Reserved typically withdraws, reduces communication, becomes terse; may appear indifferent. Together this often produces a cool, mistrustful stance: blunt critique followed by distance and low repair.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people.

**Primary derail risks**:
- conflict escalation
- low collaboration
- low trust climate
- missed signals

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, very low warmth, high directness, low guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.
- Acknowledge contributions without demanding emotional display (‘That analysis improved the decision’).

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “It seems we’re going quiet. Let’s capture questions in writing and reconvene tomorrow with a decision.”**

### Skeptical + Leisurely

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people.

**Primary derail risks**:
- conflict escalation
- low trust climate
- missed deadlines
- passive resistance

**Coach stance: very high structure, very high autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:

When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- conflict escalation

### Skeptical + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people—and may comply outwardly while quietly collecting evidence and testing trust.

**Primary derail risks**:
- surface compliance with hidden mistrust; back-channeling instead of direct resolution
- conflict escalation

### Cautious + Reserved

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Reserved wants space, autonomy, and low-pressure connection. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Reserved typically withdraws, reduces communication, becomes terse; may appear indifferent. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- low collaboration
- missed opportunities
- missed signals

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Make success criteria explicit and binary where possible (what ‘good’ looks like).
- Normalize learning: review decisions by quality of process, not outcome alone.
- Provide rehearsal and pre‑briefs before high-stakes interactions.
- Acknowledge contributions without demanding emotional display (‘That analysis improved the decision’).

**Avoid**:
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Rewarding only perfect outcomes.
- Threat-based motivation (‘If this fails…’).
- Vague encouragement (‘Be bolder’) without guardrails.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

### Cautious + Leisurely

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- missed deadlines
- missed opportunities
- passive resistance

**Coach stance: very high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).
- Make commitments explicit: deliverable, date, quality bar, and what ‘done’ means.

**Avoid**:
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.
- Public cornering.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Cautious + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ignoring risks
- missed opportunities
- toxic ego culture

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, very high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “To win the outcome, we’ll use the metric. Let’s agree what evidence would change our minds.”**

### Cautious + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk oscillation: bursts of bold action followed by second-guessing and retreat.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ethics/compliance violations
- missed opportunities
- reckless decisions

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, very high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Cautious + Colorful

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- distracting the team
- missed opportunities
- overpromising

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, high warmth, moderate directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.
- Create a ‘stage’ that serves the mission (presentations, community), not internal drama.
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Give structured airtime (time-boxed updates, storytelling with a point).
- Make success criteria explicit and binary where possible (what ‘good’ looks like).

**Avoid**:
- Assuming enthusiasm equals follow-through.
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Letting meetings become unbounded monologues.
- Publicly embarrassing them.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**

### Cautious + Imaginative

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- impractical plans
- missed opportunities
- scope creep

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, very high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Make success criteria explicit and binary where possible (what ‘good’ looks like).
- Normalize learning: review decisions by quality of process, not outcome alone.
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.
- Provide rehearsal and pre‑briefs before high-stakes interactions.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Killing ideas instantly without acknowledging the underlying insight.
- Letting ideas skip feasibility/ethics checks.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**

### Cautious + Diligent

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, very high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “We’re stuck in analysis. Let’s time-box 20 minutes to define ‘good enough’, choose the smallest test, and set a decision date.”**

### Cautious + Dutiful

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Dutiful wants clear expectations, approval, and relational security. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Dutiful typically defers to others, says yes too quickly, avoids conflict; later feels resentful or overwhelmed. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- lack of candor
- missed opportunities
- overcommitment

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, high warmth, moderate directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Make success criteria explicit and binary where possible (what ‘good’ looks like).
- Normalize learning: review decisions by quality of process, not outcome alone.
- Provide rehearsal and pre‑briefs before high-stakes interactions.
- Ask for independent recommendations before group discussion (reduces conformity).

**Avoid**:
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Rewarding only perfect outcomes.
- Threat-based motivation (‘If this fails…’).
- Vague encouragement (‘Be bolder’) without guardrails.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**

### Reserved + Leisurely

Core pattern: Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done, while Reserved wants space, autonomy, and low-pressure connection. When threatened, Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way; Reserved typically withdraws, reduces communication, becomes terse; may appear indifferent. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained.

**Primary derail risks**:
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines
- missed signals
- passive resistance

**Coach stance: moderate structure, very high autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, low guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).
- Make commitments explicit: deliverable, date, quality bar, and what ‘done’ means.
- Use calm firmness on consequences (impact-based, not moralizing).
- Acknowledge contributions without demanding emotional display (‘That analysis improved the decision’).

**Avoid**:
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.
- Public cornering.
- Telling them exactly how to do everything.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves.

**Primary derail risks**:
- distracting the team
- missed deadlines
- overpromising
- passive resistance

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.
- Create a ‘stage’ that serves the mission (presentations, community), not internal drama.
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).
- Give structured airtime (time-boxed updates, storytelling with a point).

**Avoid**:
- Assuming enthusiasm equals follow-through.
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.
- Letting meetings become unbounded monologues.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Leisurely + Imaginative

Core pattern: Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- impractical plans
- missed deadlines
- passive resistance
- scope creep

**Coach stance: moderate structure, very high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).
- Make commitments explicit: deliverable, date, quality bar, and what ‘done’ means.
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.
- Require a one-page narrative: goal, hypothesis, test, success metric, risks.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.
- Killing ideas instantly without acknowledging the underlying insight.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

### Leisurely + Diligent

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces covert obstruction: standards and process become the vehicle for resisting requests.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds.

**Primary derail risks**:
- standards/process used as covert resistance; bottlenecks and resentment
- bottlenecks
- missed deadlines
- passive resistance

**Coach stance: very high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Leisurely + Dutiful

Core pattern: Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done, while Dutiful wants clear expectations, approval, and relational security. When threatened, Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way; Dutiful typically defers to others, says yes too quickly, avoids conflict; later feels resentful or overwhelmed. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds.

**Primary derail risks**:
- lack of candor
- missed deadlines
- overcommitment
- passive resistance

**Coach stance: high structure, very high autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).
- Make commitments explicit: deliverable, date, quality bar, and what ‘done’ means.
- Use calm firmness on consequences (impact-based, not moralizing).
- Ask for independent recommendations before group discussion (reduces conformity).

**Avoid**:
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.
- Public cornering.
- Telling them exactly how to do everything.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces boundary-pushing power plays with elevated ethical and reputational risk.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks
- reckless decisions

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, very high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Bold + Colorful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves.

**Primary derail risks**:

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

- yes‑saying to a dominant figure; bad decisions go unchallenged
- ignoring risks
- lack of candor

- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations
- overpromising

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

### Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:

### Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces a push–pull between visionary leaps and perfectionistic constraints.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:

- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**

### Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas, while Dutiful wants clear expectations, approval, and relational security. When threatened, Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow; Dutiful typically defers to others, says yes too quickly, avoids conflict; later feels resentful or overwhelmed. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- impractical plans
- lack of candor
- overcommitment
- scope creep

**Coach stance: moderate structure, very high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.
- Require a one-page narrative: goal, hypothesis, test, success metric, risks.
- Start with curiosity: ‘What problem are you solving?’ then translate into constraints.
- Time-box exploration and set decision dates.
- Use ‘two-track’ execution: ideation track + feasibility track with clear gates.
- Ask for independent recommendations before group discussion (reduces conformity).

**Avoid**:
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.
- Killing ideas instantly without acknowledging the underlying insight.
- Letting ideas skip feasibility/ethics checks.
- Overloading them with micromanaged step-by-step instructions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**

### Diligent + Dutiful

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Dutiful wants clear expectations, approval, and relational security. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Dutiful typically defers to others, says yes too quickly, avoids conflict; later feels resentful or overwhelmed. Together this often produces overresponsible perfectionism: saying yes, then overworking and micromanaging to avoid disapproval.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- lack of candor
- overcommitment
- team demoralization

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.
- Ask for independent recommendations before group discussion (reduces conformity).

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.

### Excitable + Skeptical + Cautious

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Skeptical + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: skeptical tendencies add attack/test.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- conflict escalation

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.

### Excitable + Skeptical + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: skeptical tendencies add attack/test.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- conflict escalation
- ethics/compliance violations
- low trust climate

- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.

**Avoid**:

- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Cautious + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces risk oscillation: bursts of bold action followed by second-guessing and retreat. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ethics/compliance violations
- missed opportunities
- mood-driven decisions

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

### Excitable + Cautious + Colorful

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- distracting the team
- missed opportunities
- mood-driven decisions

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, high warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:

### Excitable + Cautious + Diligent

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks
- missed opportunities

### Excitable + Reserved + Leisurely

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces hot–cold engagement: intense reactions followed by shutdown and avoidance. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines
- missed signals
- mood-driven decisions

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, low guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.

### Excitable + Leisurely + Colorful

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- distracting the team
- missed deadlines
- mood-driven decisions
- overpromising

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Excitable + Leisurely + Diligent

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces covert obstruction: standards and process become the vehicle for resisting requests. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- standards/process used as covert resistance; bottlenecks and resentment
- bottlenecks
- missed deadlines
- mood-driven decisions

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.

### Excitable + Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: excitable tendencies add emotional surge.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks
- mood-driven decisions

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- distracting the team
- impractical plans
- mood-driven decisions
- overpromising

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**

### Excitable + Colorful + Diligent

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- distracting the team
- mood-driven decisions
- overpromising

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

### Excitable + Colorful + Dutiful

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

### Excitable + Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces a push–pull between visionary leaps and perfectionistic constraints. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- impractical plans
- mood-driven decisions
- relationship whiplash (idealize → devalue)

### Excitable + Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

### Excitable + Diligent + Dutiful

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces overresponsible perfectionism: saying yes, then overworking and micromanaging to avoid disapproval. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

### Skeptical + Cautious + Reserved

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- low collaboration
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “It seems we’re going quiet. Let’s capture questions in writing and reconvene tomorrow with a decision.”**

### Skeptical + Cautious + Leisurely

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- low trust climate
- missed deadlines

**Coach stance: very high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Make commitments and decision criteria explicit in writing to prevent covert resistance and motive debates.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Skeptical + Cautious + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “To win the outcome, we’ll use the metric. Let’s agree what evidence would change our minds.”**

### Skeptical + Cautious + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- ethics/compliance violations
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Skeptical + Cautious + Diligent

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people.

Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people—and may comply outwardly while quietly collecting evidence and testing trust.

**Primary derail risks**:
- surface compliance with hidden mistrust; back-channeling instead of direct resolution

### Skeptical + Reserved + Leisurely

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a cool, mistrustful stance: blunt critique followed by distance and low repair. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people.

### Skeptical + Reserved + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- conflict escalation
- ignoring risks
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, very low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “It seems we’re going quiet. Let’s capture questions in writing and reconvene tomorrow with a decision.”**

### Skeptical + Reserved + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a cool, mistrustful stance: blunt critique followed by distance and low repair. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- conflict escalation
- ethics/compliance violations
- low collaboration
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

### Skeptical + Reserved + Colorful

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces a cool, mistrustful stance: blunt critique followed by distance and low repair. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves.

**Primary derail risks**:
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- conflict escalation
- distracting the team
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, low guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

### Skeptical + Reserved + Imaginative

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces a cool, mistrustful stance: blunt critique followed by distance and low repair. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- conflict escalation
- impractical plans
- low collaboration
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

### Skeptical + Reserved + Diligent

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces a cool, mistrustful stance: blunt critique followed by distance and low repair. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- conflict escalation
- low collaboration
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, very low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.

### Skeptical + Reserved + Dutiful

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Reserved wants space, autonomy, and low-pressure connection. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Reserved typically withdraws, reduces communication, becomes terse; may appear indifferent. Together this often produces a cool, mistrustful stance: blunt critique followed by distance and low repair. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people—and may comply outwardly while quietly collecting evidence and testing trust.

**Primary derail risks**:
- surface compliance with hidden mistrust; back-channeling instead of direct resolution
- conflict escalation
- lack of candor
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, high directness, low guardrails.**

**Do**:

### Skeptical + Leisurely + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- conflict escalation
- ignoring risks

### Skeptical + Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: skeptical tendencies add attack/test.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- conflict escalation
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- conflict escalation
- ignoring risks
- impractical plans

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “To win the outcome, we’ll use the metric. Let’s agree what evidence would change our minds.”**

### Skeptical + Bold + Diligent

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: diligent tendencies add control/perfect.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- bottlenecks
- conflict escalation
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, very low warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

### Skeptical + Bold + Dutiful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism—and may comply outwardly while quietly collecting evidence and testing trust.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- yes‑saying to a dominant figure; bad decisions go unchallenged
- surface compliance with hidden mistrust; back-channeling instead of direct resolution
- conflict escalation

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Formalize dissent: require a ‘risk and objection’ section before commitments; praise principled pushback.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’

**Reset script: “To win the outcome, we’ll use the metric. Let’s agree what evidence would change our minds.”**

### Skeptical + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- conflict escalation
- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, very high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.

### Skeptical + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- conflict escalation
- distracting the team
- impractical plans
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

### Skeptical + Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces a push–pull between visionary leaps and perfectionistic constraints. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

### Skeptical + Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

### Skeptical + Diligent + Dutiful

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces overresponsible perfectionism: saying yes, then overworking and micromanaging to avoid disapproval. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people—and may comply outwardly while quietly collecting evidence and testing trust.

### Cautious + Reserved + Leisurely

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).
- Make commitments explicit: deliverable, date, quality bar, and what ‘done’ means.

**Avoid**:
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.
- Public cornering.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Cautious + Reserved + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ignoring risks
- low collaboration
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

### Cautious + Reserved + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk oscillation: bursts of bold action followed by second-guessing and retreat. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ethics/compliance violations
- low collaboration
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

### Cautious + Reserved + Colorful

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves.

**Primary derail risks**:
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- analysis paralysis
- distracting the team
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.
- Create a ‘stage’ that serves the mission (presentations, community), not internal drama.
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Give structured airtime (time-boxed updates, storytelling with a point).
- Make success criteria explicit and binary where possible (what ‘good’ looks like).

**Avoid**:
- Assuming enthusiasm equals follow-through.
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Letting meetings become unbounded monologues.
- Publicly embarrassing them.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

### Cautious + Reserved + Imaginative

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- impractical plans
- low collaboration
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Make success criteria explicit and binary where possible (what ‘good’ looks like).
- Normalize learning: review decisions by quality of process, not outcome alone.
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.
- Provide rehearsal and pre‑briefs before high-stakes interactions.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Killing ideas instantly without acknowledging the underlying insight.
- Letting ideas skip feasibility/ethics checks.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “It seems we’re going quiet. Let’s capture questions in writing and reconvene tomorrow with a decision.”**

### Cautious + Reserved + Diligent

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “We’re stuck in analysis. Let’s time-box 20 minutes to define ‘good enough’, choose the smallest test, and set a decision date.”**

### Cautious + Reserved + Dutiful

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Reserved wants space, autonomy, and low-pressure connection. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Reserved typically withdraws, reduces communication, becomes terse; may appear indifferent. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- lack of candor
- low collaboration
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Make success criteria explicit and binary where possible (what ‘good’ looks like).
- Normalize learning: review decisions by quality of process, not outcome alone.
- Provide rehearsal and pre‑briefs before high-stakes interactions.
- Acknowledge contributions without demanding emotional display (‘That analysis improved the decision’).

**Avoid**:
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Rewarding only perfect outcomes.
- Threat-based motivation (‘If this fails…’).
- Vague encouragement (‘Be bolder’) without guardrails.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “It seems we’re going quiet. Let’s capture questions in writing and reconvene tomorrow with a decision.”**

### Cautious + Leisurely + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ignoring risks
- missed deadlines
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Cautious + Leisurely + Colorful

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way.

- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- analysis paralysis
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, very high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, very high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “We’re stuck in analysis. Let’s time-box 20 minutes to define ‘good enough’, choose the smallest test, and set a decision date.”**

### Cautious + Bold + Dutiful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- yes‑saying to a dominant figure; bad decisions go unchallenged
- analysis paralysis
- ignoring risks
- lack of candor

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Formalize dissent: require a ‘risk and objection’ section before commitments; praise principled pushback.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “To win the outcome, we’ll use the metric. Let’s agree what evidence would change our minds.”**

### Cautious + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk oscillation: bursts of bold action followed by second-guessing and retreat. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- analysis paralysis
- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

### Cautious + Mischievous + Imaginative

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk oscillation: bursts of bold action followed by second-guessing and retreat. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- big bets with weak validation; volatility in priorities
- analysis paralysis
- ethics/compliance violations
- impractical plans

### Cautious + Mischievous + Diligent

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, very high guardrails.**

### Cautious + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- distracting the team
- impractical plans
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.
- Create a ‘stage’ that serves the mission (presentations, community), not internal drama.
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Give structured airtime (time-boxed updates, storytelling with a point).

**Avoid**:
- Assuming enthusiasm equals follow-through.
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Killing ideas instantly without acknowledging the underlying insight.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.

**Avoid**:

### Reserved + Leisurely + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism.

**Primary derail risks**:
- ignoring risks
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines
- missed signals

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Reserved + Leisurely + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.

### Reserved + Leisurely + Colorful

Core pattern: Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves.

**Primary derail risks**:
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- distracting the team
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, low guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.
- Create a ‘stage’ that serves the mission (presentations, community), not internal drama.
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).
- Give structured airtime (time-boxed updates, storytelling with a point).

**Avoid**:
- Assuming enthusiasm equals follow-through.
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.
- Letting meetings become unbounded monologues.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

Core pattern: Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- impractical plans
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines
- missed signals

**Coach stance: moderate structure, very high autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).
- Make commitments explicit: deliverable, date, quality bar, and what ‘done’ means.
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.
- Require a one-page narrative: goal, hypothesis, test, success metric, risks.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.
- Killing ideas instantly without acknowledging the underlying insight.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Reserved + Leisurely + Diligent

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces covert obstruction: standards and process become the vehicle for resisting requests. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained.

**Primary derail risks**:
- standards/process used as covert resistance; bottlenecks and resentment
- bottlenecks
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Reserved + Leisurely + Dutiful

Core pattern: Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done, while Reserved wants space, autonomy, and low-pressure connection. When threatened, Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way; Reserved typically withdraws, reduces communication, becomes terse; may appear indifferent. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained.

**Primary derail risks**:
- lack of candor
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines
- missed signals

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, low guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).
- Make commitments explicit: deliverable, date, quality bar, and what ‘done’ means.
- Use calm firmness on consequences (impact-based, not moralizing).
- Acknowledge contributions without demanding emotional display (‘That analysis improved the decision’).

**Avoid**:
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.
- Public cornering.
- Telling them exactly how to do everything.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Reserved + Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces boundary-pushing power plays with elevated ethical and reputational risk. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: moderate structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Reserved + Bold + Colorful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves.

**Primary derail risks**:
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- distracting the team
- ignoring risks
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: moderate structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.

When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces a push–pull between visionary leaps and perfectionistic constraints. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- impractical plans
- low collaboration
- missed signals

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “It seems we’re going quiet. Let’s capture questions in writing and reconvene tomorrow with a decision.”**

### Reserved + Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas, while Reserved wants space, autonomy, and low-pressure connection. When threatened, Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow; Reserved typically withdraws, reduces communication, becomes terse; may appear indifferent. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- impractical plans
- lack of candor
- low collaboration
- missed signals

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.
- Require a one-page narrative: goal, hypothesis, test, success metric, risks.
- Start with curiosity: ‘What problem are you solving?’ then translate into constraints.
- Time-box exploration and set decision dates.
- Use ‘two-track’ execution: ideation track + feasibility track with clear gates.
- Acknowledge contributions without demanding emotional display (‘That analysis improved the decision’).

**Avoid**:
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.
- Killing ideas instantly without acknowledging the underlying insight.
- Letting ideas skip feasibility/ethics checks.
- Overloading them with micromanaged step-by-step instructions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “It seems we’re going quiet. Let’s capture questions in writing and reconvene tomorrow with a decision.”**

### Reserved + Diligent + Dutiful

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Reserved wants space, autonomy, and low-pressure connection. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Reserved typically withdraws, reduces communication, becomes terse; may appear indifferent. Together this often produces overresponsible perfectionism: saying yes, then overworking and micromanaging to avoid disapproval. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained.

### Leisurely + Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces boundary-pushing power plays with elevated ethical and reputational risk. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks
- missed deadlines

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Leisurely + Bold + Colorful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves.

**Primary derail risks**:

- ignoring risks
- missed deadlines
- overpromising

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:

- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.

- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

- Letting meetings become unbounded monologues.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Leisurely + Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces covert obstruction: standards and process become the vehicle for resisting requests. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- standards/process used as covert resistance; bottlenecks and resentment
- bottlenecks
- impractical plans
- missed deadlines

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

### Leisurely + Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- impractical plans
- lack of candor
- missed deadlines
- overcommitment

**Coach stance: moderate structure, very high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).
- Make commitments explicit: deliverable, date, quality bar, and what ‘done’ means.
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.
- Require a one-page narrative: goal, hypothesis, test, success metric, risks.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.
- Killing ideas instantly without acknowledging the underlying insight.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

### Bold + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces boundary-pushing power plays with elevated ethical and reputational risk. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and may alternate between rule-bending impulses and image-protecting compliance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak

### Bold + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

### Mischievous + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details.

- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Mischievous + Colorful + Dutiful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and may alternate between rule-bending impulses and image-protecting compliance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations
- lack of candor

### Mischievous + Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces a push–pull between visionary leaps and perfectionistic constraints. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- big bets with weak validation; volatility in priorities
- bottlenecks
- ethics/compliance violations
- impractical plans

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.

### Mischievous + Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow.

### Colorful + Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- distracting the team
- impractical plans

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

# Part 4 — High/elevated trait quadruples (330)


---

### Excitable + Skeptical + Cautious + Reserved

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Skeptical + Cautious + Leisurely

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Make commitments and decision criteria explicit in writing to prevent covert resistance and motive debates.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

### Excitable + Skeptical + Cautious + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: skeptical tendencies add attack/test; cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

### Excitable + Skeptical + Cautious + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: skeptical tendencies add attack/test; cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- impractical plans

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Skeptical + Cautious + Diligent

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: diligent tendencies add control/perfect; cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and may comply outwardly while quietly collecting evidence and testing trust.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- surface compliance with hidden mistrust; back-channeling instead of direct resolution
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:

### Excitable + Skeptical + Reserved + Leisurely

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- conflict escalation
- low collaboration
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, high directness, low guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Make commitments and decision criteria explicit in writing to prevent covert resistance and motive debates.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

### Excitable + Skeptical + Reserved + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: skeptical tendencies add attack/test; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- conflict escalation
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

### Excitable + Skeptical + Reserved + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: skeptical tendencies add attack/test; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- conflict escalation
- ethics/compliance violations
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

### Excitable + Skeptical + Leisurely + Imaginative

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- conflict escalation
- impractical plans
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Make commitments and decision criteria explicit in writing to prevent covert resistance and motive debates.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

### Excitable + Skeptical + Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: excitable tendencies add emotional surge; skeptical tendencies add attack/test.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- conflict escalation

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- rapid escalation and relationship rupture; hard recovery if not repaired quickly
- conflict escalation
- distracting the team
- impractical plans

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use rapid de-escalation plus repair: validate, pause, return with facts and a written agreement.
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Skeptical + Colorful + Diligent

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges.

### Excitable + Cautious + Reserved + Leisurely

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces hot–cold engagement: intense reactions followed by shutdown and avoidance. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Excitable + Cautious + Reserved + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance; and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ignoring risks
- low collaboration
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Cautious + Reserved + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces hot–cold engagement: intense reactions followed by shutdown and avoidance. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ethics/compliance violations
- low collaboration
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Excitable + Cautious + Reserved + Diligent

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).

- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “We’re stuck in analysis. Let’s time-box 20 minutes to define ‘good enough’, choose the smallest test, and set a decision date.”**

- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “It seems we’re going quiet. Let’s capture questions in writing and reconvene tomorrow with a decision.”**

### Excitable + Cautious + Leisurely + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ignoring risks
- missed deadlines
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Cautious + Leisurely + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces risk oscillation: bursts of bold action followed by second-guessing and retreat. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ethics/compliance violations
- missed deadlines
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

### Excitable + Cautious + Leisurely + Colorful

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance.

### Excitable + Cautious + Leisurely + Diligent

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- standards/process used as covert resistance; bottlenecks and resentment
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.

### Excitable + Cautious + Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: excitable tendencies add emotional surge; cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- analysis paralysis
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, very high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

### Excitable + Cautious + Mischievous + Diligent

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: diligent tendencies add control/perfect; cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.

- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

### Excitable + Cautious + Mischievous + Dutiful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces risk oscillation: bursts of bold action followed by second-guessing and retreat. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and may alternate between rule-bending impulses and image-protecting compliance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ethics/compliance violations
- lack of candor
- missed opportunities

### Excitable + Cautious + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- distracting the team
- impractical plans
- missed opportunities

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

### Excitable + Reserved + Leisurely + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- ignoring risks
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines
- missed signals

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Reserved + Leisurely + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces hot–cold engagement: intense reactions followed by shutdown and avoidance. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- ethics/compliance violations
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines

When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces covert obstruction: standards and process become the vehicle for resisting requests. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- standards/process used as covert resistance; bottlenecks and resentment
- bottlenecks
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Excitable + Reserved + Leisurely + Dutiful

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces hot–cold engagement: intense reactions followed by shutdown and avoidance. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:

- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.

### Excitable + Reserved + Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: excitable tendencies add emotional surge; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Reserved + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’.

### Excitable + Reserved + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- distracting the team
- impractical plans
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: moderate structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

### Excitable + Reserved + Colorful + Dutiful

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces hot–cold engagement: intense reactions followed by shutdown and avoidance. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- distracting the team
- lack of candor
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, low guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

### Excitable + Reserved + Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces hot–cold engagement: intense reactions followed by shutdown and avoidance. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and can look ‘hot–cold’: intense reactions followed by shutdown and distance; and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- impractical plans
- low collaboration
- missed signals

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid chasing immediate resolution during shutdown; agree a pause and return time instead.
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).

### Excitable + Reserved + Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow.

When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions.

### Excitable + Leisurely + Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: excitable tendencies add emotional surge; leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks
- missed deadlines

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Leisurely + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations
- missed deadlines

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:

- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Excitable + Leisurely + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- distracting the team
- impractical plans
- missed deadlines
- mood-driven decisions

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Excitable + Leisurely + Colorful + Diligent

Core pattern: Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces covert obstruction: standards and process become the vehicle for resisting requests. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- standards/process used as covert resistance; bottlenecks and resentment
- bottlenecks
- distracting the team
- missed deadlines

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

### Excitable + Bold + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: excitable tendencies add emotional surge; colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.

- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

- distracting the team
- ignoring risks
- lack of candor

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Formalize dissent: require a ‘risk and objection’ section before commitments; praise principled pushback.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

**Reset script: “We’re escalating. Let’s pause for 30 minutes. When we return, we’ll agree on the decision criteria, list the facts we both accept, and pick the next step.”**

### Excitable + Bold + Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: diligent tendencies add control/perfect; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- ignoring risks
- impractical plans
- mood-driven decisions

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces high-intensity conflict spikes that can quickly polarize people. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

### Excitable + Mischievous + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Excitable wants reliability, emotional steadiness, and fast repair after ruptures. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Excitable typically escalates emotionally, then may abruptly disengage or ‘cut off’. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- big bets with weak validation; volatility in priorities
- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

Together this often produces overresponsible perfectionism: saying yes, then overworking and micromanaging to avoid disapproval. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then spikes emotionally—presses hard, then may abruptly disengage when disappointed—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- impractical plans
- lack of candor
- mood-driven decisions

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- After a blow-up, do a structured repair: what happened, impact, what we’ll do differently, and a small recommitment.
- Keep agreements meticulously; if you cannot, renegotiate early with a clear reason and a new date.
- Name emotions without debate (“I can see this feels frustrating”), then pivot to the next concrete step.
- Use short, frequent check-ins with a predictable cadence (removes ‘surprise stress’).
- When conflict spikes, call a brief pause and set an exact time to resume (prevents impulsive exits).
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.

**Avoid**:
- Ambiguous commitments (“We’ll see”).
- Minimizing their reaction (“You’re overreacting”).
- Public feedback when they’re hot.
- Withholding information and then ‘surprising’ them with decisions.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- When emotion spikes, we pause for 15–60 minutes and reconvene at a scheduled time to finish the decision.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**

### Skeptical + Cautious + Reserved + Leisurely

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- low collaboration
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Make commitments and decision criteria explicit in writing to prevent covert resistance and motive debates.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Skeptical + Cautious + Reserved + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “It seems we’re going quiet. Let’s capture questions in writing and reconvene tomorrow with a decision.”**

### Skeptical + Cautious + Reserved + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- ethics/compliance violations
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

### Skeptical + Cautious + Reserved + Diligent

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks
- conflict escalation

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people—and may comply outwardly while quietly collecting evidence and testing trust.

**Primary derail risks**:
- surface compliance with hidden mistrust; back-channeling instead of direct resolution

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people—and may comply outwardly while quietly collecting evidence and testing trust.

**Primary derail risks**:
- surface compliance with hidden mistrust; back-channeling instead of direct resolution
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- lack of candor

**Coach stance: very high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Make commitments and decision criteria explicit in writing to prevent covert resistance and motive debates.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Skeptical + Cautious + Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: skeptical tendencies add attack/test; cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, very high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Skeptical + Cautious + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- distracting the team

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

**Avoid**:

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks
- conflict escalation

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

### Skeptical + Cautious + Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints—and may comply outwardly while quietly collecting evidence and testing trust.

**Primary derail risks**:
- surface compliance with hidden mistrust; back-channeling instead of direct resolution
- analysis paralysis
- conflict escalation
- impractical plans

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

### Skeptical + Cautious + Diligent + Dutiful

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

### Skeptical + Reserved + Leisurely + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- conflict escalation
- ignoring risks
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, very low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Make commitments and decision criteria explicit in writing to prevent covert resistance and motive debates.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Skeptical + Reserved + Leisurely + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a cool, mistrustful stance: blunt critique followed by distance and low repair. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- conflict escalation
- ethics/compliance violations
- low collaboration
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Make commitments and decision criteria explicit in writing to prevent covert resistance and motive debates.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.

### Skeptical + Reserved + Leisurely + Colorful

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a cool, mistrustful stance: blunt critique followed by distance and low repair. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves.

**Primary derail risks**:
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- conflict escalation
- distracting the team
- low collaboration

### Skeptical + Reserved + Leisurely + Diligent

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces covert obstruction: standards and process become the vehicle for resisting requests. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- conflict escalation
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, very low warmth, very high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:

- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- yes‑saying to a dominant figure; bad decisions go unchallenged
- surface compliance with hidden mistrust; back-channeling instead of direct resolution
- conflict escalation

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Formalize dissent: require a ‘risk and objection’ section before commitments; praise principled pushback.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “It seems we’re going quiet. Let’s capture questions in writing and reconvene tomorrow with a decision.”**

### Skeptical + Reserved + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a cool, mistrustful stance: blunt critique followed by distance and low repair. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- conflict escalation
- distracting the team

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

### Skeptical + Reserved + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility.

- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).

### Skeptical + Leisurely + Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: skeptical tendencies add attack/test; leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- conflict escalation
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Make commitments and decision criteria explicit in writing to prevent covert resistance and motive debates.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.

- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

### Skeptical + Leisurely + Bold + Diligent

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: diligent tendencies add control/perfect; leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- standards/process used as covert resistance; bottlenecks and resentment
- bottlenecks
- conflict escalation

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, very low warmth, very high directness, moderate guardrails.**

### Skeptical + Leisurely + Bold + Dutiful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism—and may comply outwardly while quietly collecting evidence and testing trust.

**Primary derail risks**:
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- yes‑saying to a dominant figure; bad decisions go unchallenged
- surface compliance with hidden mistrust; back-channeling instead of direct resolution
- conflict escalation

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Make commitments and decision criteria explicit in writing to prevent covert resistance and motive debates.
- Formalize dissent: require a ‘risk and objection’ section before commitments; praise principled pushback.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.

### Skeptical + Leisurely + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- conflict escalation
- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, very high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Make commitments and decision criteria explicit in writing to prevent covert resistance and motive debates.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

### Skeptical + Leisurely + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- conflict escalation
- distracting the team
- impractical plans
- low trust climate

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Make commitments and decision criteria explicit in writing to prevent covert resistance and motive debates.
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.

### Skeptical + Bold + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: skeptical tendencies add attack/test; colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- conflict escalation

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

### Skeptical + Bold + Mischievous + Imaginative

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: skeptical tendencies add attack/test; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover

### Skeptical + Bold + Mischievous + Dutiful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces a combative, status-driven style where disagreement becomes a loyalty or respect test. Secondary signals: skeptical tendencies add attack/test; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and may alternate between rule-bending impulses and image-protecting compliance; and may comply outwardly while quietly collecting evidence and testing trust.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- power conflicts and ‘win/lose’ debates that drive turnover
- yes‑saying to a dominant figure; bad decisions go unchallenged
- surface compliance with hidden mistrust; back-channeling instead of direct resolution

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Formalize dissent: require a ‘risk and objection’ section before commitments; praise principled pushback.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).

### Skeptical + Mischievous + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges.

- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.

**Avoid**:

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- big bets with weak validation; volatility in priorities
- bottlenecks
- conflict escalation
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, low warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- No back-channel decisions: changes are surfaced early, with rationale and options.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Skeptical + Mischievous + Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and may alternate between rule-bending impulses and image-protecting compliance; and may comply outwardly while quietly collecting evidence and testing trust.

**Primary derail risks**:
- big bets with weak validation; volatility in priorities
- surface compliance with hidden mistrust; back-channeling instead of direct resolution
- conflict escalation
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:

### Skeptical + Mischievous + Diligent + Dutiful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges. Together this often produces overresponsible perfectionism: saying yes, then overworking and micromanaging to avoid disapproval. Secondary signals: diligent tendencies add control/perfect; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

### Skeptical + Colorful + Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Skeptical wants fairness, transparency, and evidence that people are acting in good faith, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Skeptical typically questions motives, challenges, tests loyalty; may blame or hold grudges; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then questions motives, scrutinizes fairness, and pushes into debate to ‘test’ people; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- conflict escalation
- distracting the team
- impractical plans

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Acknowledge their ‘valid point’ early to prevent them from escalating to be heard.
- Document agreements and next steps in writing—position it as efficiency, not mistrust.
- Give them choices where possible (two acceptable paths) to reduce perceived control games.
- Lead with facts, decision criteria, and process transparency (how the decision is made, by whom, and when).
- Separate intent from impact; focus on observable behavior and measurable outcomes.

**Avoid**:
- Asking for blind trust (‘Just trust me’).
- Over‑selling, spin, or flattery (reads as manipulation).
- Publicly correcting them (they’ll interpret as status attack).
- Surprise changes to scope/roles without discussion.

### Cautious + Reserved + Leisurely + Bold

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ignoring risks
- low collaboration
- missed deadlines

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Cautious + Reserved + Leisurely + Mischievous

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk oscillation: bursts of bold action followed by second-guessing and retreat. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- ethics/compliance violations

- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:

### Cautious + Reserved + Leisurely + Colorful

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves.

**Primary derail risks**:
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- analysis paralysis
- distracting the team
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.
- Create a ‘stage’ that serves the mission (presentations, community), not internal drama.
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).

**Avoid**:
- Assuming enthusiasm equals follow-through.
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.

### Cautious + Reserved + Leisurely + Diligent

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- standards/process used as covert resistance; bottlenecks and resentment
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.

Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- analysis paralysis
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Cautious + Reserved + Bold + Colorful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- analysis paralysis
- distracting the team
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).

- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

### Cautious + Reserved + Bold + Diligent

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:

- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.

### Cautious + Reserved + Bold + Dutiful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

- analysis paralysis
- ignoring risks
- lack of candor

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

### Cautious + Reserved + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk oscillation: bursts of bold action followed by second-guessing and retreat. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- analysis paralysis
- distracting the team

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

- Create a ‘stage’ that serves the mission (presentations, community), not internal drama.
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Give structured airtime (time-boxed updates, storytelling with a point).

**Avoid**:

- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Killing ideas instantly without acknowledging the underlying insight.
- Letting ideas skip feasibility/ethics checks.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

### Cautious + Reserved + Diligent + Dutiful

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks
- lack of candor

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “We’re stuck in analysis. Let’s time-box 20 minutes to define ‘good enough’, choose the smallest test, and set a decision date.”**

### Cautious + Leisurely + Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; leisurely tendencies add passive resist.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- analysis paralysis
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, very high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Cautious + Leisurely + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk oscillation: bursts of bold action followed by second-guessing and retreat. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- analysis paralysis
- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

### Cautious + Leisurely + Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- standards/process used as covert resistance; bottlenecks and resentment
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “We’re stuck in analysis. Let’s time-box 20 minutes to define ‘good enough’, choose the smallest test, and set a decision date.”**

### Cautious + Leisurely + Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- analysis paralysis
- impractical plans
- lack of candor
- missed deadlines

**Coach stance: high structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).
- Make commitments explicit: deliverable, date, quality bar, and what ‘done’ means.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

### Cautious + Bold + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces anxious defensiveness: outward toughness masking fear of error, leading to volatility or blame. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and often oscillates between bold declarations and private risk-avoidance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- analysis paralysis
- distracting the team

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, very high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

### Cautious + Mischievous + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- big bets with weak validation; volatility in priorities
- analysis paralysis
- distracting the team

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.
- Risk is bounded via staged commitments; we do small tests before irreversible moves.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Cautious + Mischievous + Colorful + Diligent

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces risk-avoidant overcontrol: slow decisions, heavy checking, and reluctance to commit. Secondary signals: cautious tendencies add freeze/avoid; colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- decision paralysis from over-analysis plus perfectionistic rework
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- analysis paralysis
- bottlenecks

**Coach stance: very high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Use staged decision gates with time-boxes: explore, test, commit; define ‘good enough’ at each gate.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.

### Cautious + Mischievous + Colorful + Dutiful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance. Together this often produces risk oscillation: bursts of bold action followed by second-guessing and retreat. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and may alternate between rule-bending impulses and image-protecting compliance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse

### Cautious + Colorful + Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Cautious wants psychological safety, clear risk boundaries, and permission to learn, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Cautious typically slows, delays, over-analyzes, or avoids decisions; seeks excessive reassurance; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile starts scanning for downside and delaying commitment until risk is clarified; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Break decisions into staged gates (explore → test → commit) to reduce all-or-nothing fear.
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.
- Create a ‘stage’ that serves the mission (presentations, community), not internal drama.
- Define ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments with capped downside (time, budget, scope).
- Give structured airtime (time-boxed updates, storytelling with a point).

**Avoid**:
- Assuming enthusiasm equals follow-through.
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.
- Forcing instant decisions in public forums.
- Killing ideas instantly without acknowledging the underlying insight.

### Reserved + Leisurely + Bold + Mischievous

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces boundary-pushing power plays with elevated ethical and reputational risk. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces covert obstruction: standards and process become the vehicle for resisting requests. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism.

**Primary derail risks**:
- standards/process used as covert resistance; bottlenecks and resentment
- bottlenecks
- ignoring risks
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, very low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Reserved + Leisurely + Bold + Dutiful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism.

**Primary derail risks**:
- yes‑saying to a dominant figure; bad decisions go unchallenged
- ignoring risks
- lack of candor
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Formalize dissent: require a ‘risk and objection’ section before commitments; praise principled pushback.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.

- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

### Reserved + Leisurely + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

### Reserved + Leisurely + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- distracting the team
- impractical plans
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Agree on outcomes and boundaries, then give autonomy on method.
- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.
- Create a ‘stage’ that serves the mission (presentations, community), not internal drama.
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).

**Avoid**:
- Assuming enthusiasm equals follow-through.
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.
- Escalating pressure without renegotiating scope or resources.
- Interpreting ‘yes’ as true commitment without clarification.

### Reserved + Bold + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces boundary-pushing power plays with elevated ethical and reputational risk. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- distracting the team

**Coach stance: moderate structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “Before we act, we run the 3 checks: legality, stakeholder harm, and downside cap. If it passes, you have latitude.”**

### Reserved + Bold + Mischievous + Diligent

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces boundary-pushing power plays with elevated ethical and reputational risk. Secondary signals: diligent tendencies add control/perfect; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- bottlenecks
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, very low warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

### Reserved + Bold + Mischievous + Dutiful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces boundary-pushing power plays with elevated ethical and reputational risk. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and may alternate between rule-bending impulses and image-protecting compliance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- yes‑saying to a dominant figure; bad decisions go unchallenged
- ethics/compliance violations
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: moderate structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.

### Reserved + Bold + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints.

**Primary derail risks**:
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- distracting the team
- ignoring risks
- impractical plans

**Coach stance: moderate structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

### Reserved + Bold + Colorful + Diligent

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces a mixed defensive style that can derail under stress unless expectations and boundaries are explicit. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

### Reserved + Bold + Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions.

### Reserved + Mischievous + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.

**Avoid**:

### Reserved + Mischievous + Diligent + Dutiful

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces overresponsible perfectionism: saying yes, then overworking and micromanaging to avoid disapproval. Secondary signals: reserved tendencies add withdraw; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and may alternate between rule-bending impulses and image-protecting compliance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- ethics/compliance violations
- lack of candor
- low collaboration

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Communication norms are explicit (written updates, meeting cadence) so silence does not equal alignment.

### Reserved + Colorful + Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap; reserved tendencies add withdraw.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then reduces communication and emotional bandwidth, going quiet and self-contained; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- mixed social signals that confuse others: public warmth vs private distance
- bottlenecks
- distracting the team
- impractical plans

**Coach stance: moderate structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

### Reserved + Colorful + Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally, while Imaginative wants novelty, intellectual freedom, and respect for unconventional ideas. When threatened, Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details; Imaginative typically pursues unusual angles, may ignore constraints; can seem unpredictable or hard to follow. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility.

- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.
- Create a ‘stage’ that serves the mission (presentations, community), not internal drama.
- Give structured airtime (time-boxed updates, storytelling with a point).
- Pair them with an operator who loves closure; protect both from mutual contempt.
- Praise substance (impact, outcomes) more than performance (charisma).

**Avoid**:
- Assuming enthusiasm equals follow-through.
- Assuming others ‘get it’—force clarity gently.
- Killing ideas instantly without acknowledging the underlying insight.
- Letting ideas skip feasibility/ethics checks.

### Leisurely + Bold + Mischievous + Colorful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces boundary-pushing power plays with elevated ethical and reputational risk. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; colorful tendencies add perform/amplify.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

- yes‑saying to a dominant figure; bad decisions go unchallenged
- ignoring risks
- impractical plans
- lack of candor

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Formalize dissent: require a ‘risk and objection’ section before commitments; praise principled pushback.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Every ‘yes’ becomes a specific commitment (deliverable, date, definition of done) or a renegotiation on the spot.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “I’m hearing a ‘yes’ but not a commitment. Let’s choose: commit with a deliverable/date, renegotiate scope, or decline.”**

### Leisurely + Bold + Diligent + Dutiful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces covert obstruction: standards and process become the vehicle for resisting requests. Secondary signals: leisurely tendencies add passive resist; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism.

**Primary derail risks**:
- standards/process used as covert resistance; bottlenecks and resentment
- yes‑saying to a dominant figure; bad decisions go unchallenged
- bottlenecks
- ignoring risks

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

### Leisurely + Mischievous + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries, while Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done. When threatened, Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize; Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile agrees outwardly but begins resisting through delays, ‘misunderstandings,’ and workarounds; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- big bets with weak validation; volatility in priorities
- distracting the team
- ethics/compliance violations

**Coach stance: moderate structure, high autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).
- Reward transparency about risks; punish concealment, not honest disclosure.
- Set explicit non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal) and explain why; everything else can be flexible.
- Use fast feedback loops: small bets, quick data, rapid iteration.

**Avoid**:
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Long, vague projects with little feedback.
- Loose rules with no enforcement (invites boundary testing).
- Moral lectures; use clear standards and impact.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.

### Leisurely + Colorful + Imaginative + Dutiful

Core pattern: Leisurely wants choice, respect, and control over how work gets done, while Colorful wants attention, social energy, and opportunities to influence emotionally. When threatened, Leisurely typically appears agreeable but resists later; delays, ‘forgets’, or does things their own way; Colorful typically gets dramatic, talks more, exaggerates; may dominate airtime and miss details.

- Check alignment privately: ‘Is anything about this plan not working for you?’
- Coach listening as a power move: ask them to paraphrase others before responding.
- Create a ‘stage’ that serves the mission (presentations, community), not internal drama.
- Frame requests as choices and trade-offs (‘We need A by Friday; would you prefer path 1 or 2?’).

**Avoid**:

### Bold + Mischievous + Colorful + Imaginative

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- big bets with weak validation; volatility in priorities
- distracting the team

**Coach stance: moderate structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- bottlenecks
- distracting the team

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, very high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Give them ‘controlled risk’ roles (innovation, BD) paired with governance.
- Make consequences immediate and predictable (no drama, just outcomes).

**Avoid**:
- Avoid ambiguous rules or inconsistent enforcement; it invites boundary testing and ‘game playing’.
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Assuming charm equals commitment.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Non‑negotiables (ethics, safety, legal, customer harm) are enforced immediately; autonomy exists inside guardrails.
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.

### Bold + Mischievous + Colorful + Dutiful

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Mischievous wants stimulation, autonomy, and room to experiment—within clear boundaries. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Mischievous typically takes risks, bends rules, charms to escape consequences; may rationalize. Together this often produces boundary-pushing power plays with elevated ethical and reputational risk. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; dutiful tendencies add comply/please.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then looks for loopholes, takes bolder bets, and uses charm to keep options open—and may alternate between rule-bending impulses and image-protecting compliance.

**Primary derail risks**:
- high rule-bending and ethical/reputational exposure if guardrails are weak
- overpromising and impulsive commitments that later collapse
- yes‑saying to a dominant figure; bad decisions go unchallenged

**Do**:
- Install explicit ethical/legal guardrails and a ‘no surprises’ rule; tie freedom to visible compliance.

### Bold + Colorful + Imaginative + Diligent

Core pattern: Bold wants status, respect, and opportunities to ‘win’ visibly, while Diligent wants clarity, high standards, and control over quality. When threatened, Bold typically overstates competence, dismisses feedback, dominates, blames others; Diligent typically micromanages, nitpicks, overworks, becomes critical; slows decisions. Together this often produces high-visibility idea generation with a risk of overpromising and losing operational credibility. Secondary signals: colorful tendencies add perform/amplify; imaginative tendencies add ideate/leap.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then asserts authority, amplifies confidence, and rejects constraints or criticism; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- distracting the team
- ignoring risks
- impractical plans

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, low warmth, high directness, high guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Anchor everything in metrics and external reality (KPIs, customer feedback, financials).
- Create decision guardrails (what cannot be overridden, escalation criteria).
- Give respect without submission: calm tone, professional courtesy, clear boundaries.
- Offer ‘status for accountability’: recognition tied to measurable results and team outcomes.
- Use private, direct feedback with face-saving options (‘Here’s a way to strengthen your position…’).

**Avoid**:
- Allowing them to rewrite history; document decisions and outcomes.
- Ego battles or sarcasm (they will escalate).
- Rewarding theatrics over results.
- Vague feedback they can reinterpret.

**Stress signature**: Under stress, this profile tightens standards, increases checking, and pulls decisions into their control; then seeks guidance and tries to please, often overcommitting to reduce disapproval risk; then raises intensity and visibility, talking more and steering attention to themselves; then moves into unconventional solutions, skipping steps and stretching constraints—and may cycle between ‘big leaps’ and ‘tight control’ depending on who has the floor.

**Primary derail risks**:
- bottlenecks
- distracting the team
- impractical plans
- lack of candor

**Coach stance: high structure, moderate autonomy, moderate warmth, moderate directness, moderate guardrails.**

**Do**:
- Channel creativity into a one-page narrative and time-boxed experiments; reward clarity, not theatrics.
- Define ‘definition of done’ and quality thresholds upfront.
- Give them ownership of standards/process, but limit their authority to rework everything.
- Praise delegation and throughput, not only perfection.
- Separate ‘must fix’ from ‘nice to improve’ using impact criteria.
- Time-box reviews and decisions; pre-agree what ‘good enough’ is for each context.

**Avoid**:
- Arguing taste; use standards and customer impact.
- Interpreting criticism as malice; it’s often anxiety and control.
- Letting them be the final gate for all work.
- Surprising them with low-quality deliverables.

**Micro‑contract (pre‑agreed rules that prevent derailment)**:
- Decisions use explicit criteria and a documented owner; disagreements focus on data and impact.
- Quality standards are agreed upfront; reviews are time-boxed; ‘nice-to-have’ fixes are parked unless impact is proven.
- Dissent is required: before committing, we ask ‘what could go wrong’ and ‘what would make you say no?’
- Meetings are time-boxed with an agenda; decisions end with written actions and owners.
- Ideas pass through a test gate: hypothesis, experiment, metric, constraint set, and stop rule.

**Reset script: “Let’s return to the goal, agree on criteria, and pick the next smallest action.”**
